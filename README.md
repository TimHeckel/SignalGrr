=========

### Mad Props
This code is 100% due to the hard work of David Fowler, who provided me with the [original sample code](https://github.com/davidfowl/SignalR.Relay).

### What is SignalGrr?
SignalGrr is simply a SignalR server that allows hubs to be defined purely in client-side javascript.
