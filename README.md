SignalGrr
=========

### Mad Props
This code is 100% due to the hard work of David Fowler, who provided me with the [original sample code](https://github.com/davidfowl/SignalR.Relay).

### What is SignalGrr?
SignalGrr is simply a SignalR server that allows hubs to be defined purely in client-side javascript. This is now available at Appharbor, just create a `$.hubConnection("http://signalgrr.apphb.com")` -- https also works. See below for a full example.
