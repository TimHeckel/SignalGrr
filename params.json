{"body":"### Props be first\r\nThe whole thing is inspired by David Fowler's [example code](https://github.com/davidfowl/SignalR.Relay).\r\n\r\n### What is SignalGrr?\r\nSignalGrr is just an angrier, more impulsive [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR) proxy server. Why angrier? I'm not sure. Why more impulsive? Because it's so damn simple to spin up a hub using pure javascript. I made two simple jquery plugins using SignalGrr already: [jquery.signalRamp.js - easy UI syncing](http://timheckel.github.com/SignalRamp/)  and [jquery.zyngaScroller.js - real-time kinetic scrolling](http://timheckel.github.com/ZyngaScroller/). \r\n\r\n### Can you handle it?\r\nIt's so convenient, it made me want to shove it up on [AppHarbor](http://appharbor.com), so that's precisely what I did after upgrading the code to use the latest SignalR 1.0.0 javascript client and pulling the latest code from the SignalR repository.\r\n\r\nOn AppHarbor, SignalGrr is available either\r\n\r\nhttp://signalGrr.apphb.com\r\nOR\r\nhttps://signalGrr.apphb.com\r\n\r\nNow, if you're just wanting to schlep data between clients, stop worrying about the server side hub. Just write `var conn = $.hubConnection(\"http://signalGrr.apphb.com\")` inside your javascript and you've got your entire hub!\r\n\r\n### DISCLAIMER\r\nI know SignalR Alpha is nearing completion, so the api will likely change. I'll do my best to keep SignalGrr up to date with the latest javascript client and code.\r\n\r\n### Client Usage\r\nThis is inspired by David's original source:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(function () {\r\n  var connection = $.hubConnection(\"http://signalgrr.apphb.com\"),\r\n    chat = connection.createProxy('chat');\r\n\r\n    chat.on('foo', function (n) {\r\n        console.log(n);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    connection.start().done(function () {\r\n        chat.invoke('foo', \"If Jimmy Chitwood transfers to Terhune, we don't have a prayer this year.\");\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Big Picture\r\nSignalR as an application framework has resonated with me for a long time, especially in a world with [these crazy ideas bursting forth](http://meteor.com). I have some ideas regarding data persistence inside the [jquery.signalRamp.js](http://timheckel.github.com/SignalRamp) concept, but alas that's a larger topic. More to come.","name":"SignalGrr","tagline":"A SignalR server that allows hubs to be defined purely in client-side javascript.","google":"UA-35769235-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
